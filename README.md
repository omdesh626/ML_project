Diabetes Progression Prediction Using Linear Regression:
This repository implements a solution for predicting diabetes disease progression using the Diabetes dataset from sklearn. The model employs Linear Regression to analyze physiological variables and predict disease progression over one year.

Project Overview:
The diabetes dataset consists of:

10 physiological variables such as age, sex, weight, blood pressure, etc.
442 patient records with a target value indicating disease progression.
The task involves:

Training a Linear Regression model using the training dataset (X_train, Y_train).
Predicting disease progression for the test dataset (X_test).
Saving predictions in a CSV file for evaluation.
Requirements
To run this project, ensure you have the following installed:

This project requires the following:
- Anaconda Distribution (Python 3.x)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries:
  - `numpy`
  - `scikit-learn`
  
Create a folder named diabetes_prediction in Jupyter Notebook and place the following files inside it: test_diabetes_x_test.csv (test dataset), training_diabetes_x_y_train.csv (training dataset), and LRdiabetes_model.ipynb (the notebook for the Linear Regression model). Open the notebook from this folder and run it to execute the workflow.
